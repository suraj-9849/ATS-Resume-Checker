## ✨ Introduction

**75% of resumes** never make it past **Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)** — and job seekers don't even realize it.  
**Advanced ATS Resume Checker** is here to change that.  

This tool simulates how ATS bots review resumes, highlights mistakes, provides *actionable suggestions*, and even features an **AI-powered chat assistant** to guide you in making your resume stand out. 🚀

---

## 🔥 Features

✅ Analyze resumes like a real ATS system  
✅ Highlight missing keywords and formatting issues  
✅ Personalized resume improvement suggestions  
✅ AI-powered chat assistant for live resume consultation  
✅ Detailed optimization reports  
✅ Lightweight, blazing fast, and easy to use  
✅ 100% Free and Open Source

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Upload your resume** (PDF only for now).
2. **ATS Simulation:** The app parses the resume and evaluates it based on industry-standard ATS parameters.
3. **Feedback Engine:** It suggests optimizations — like missing keywords, formatting issues, or section improvements.
4. **AI Advisor:** Need help beyond feedback? Use the chat feature for real-time advice tailored to your resume and target job role.
